# Applied-Machine-Learning
Implementation of various of algorithms described in "Applied Machine Learning" by David Forsyth

## Image segmentation using EM
**What can you expect**: Rather than using a package, I implemented the EM algorithm by myself and displayed the results for some images

## Mean Field
**What can you expect**: Mean Field Inference for denoising binary images with Boltzmann Machines on MNIST data

## EM for Topic Models
**What can you expect**: Implementation of the Topic Model EM algorithm and vizualisation of topic frequencies
